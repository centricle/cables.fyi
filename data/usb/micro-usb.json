    "USB 3.0 Micro-B is a completely different, wider connector than USB 2.0 Micro-B",

    "USB 3.0 Micro-B cables do NOT fit into USB 2.0 Micro-B ports",
    "Micro USB and Mini USB are different connectors - Micro is smaller and flatter",
    "OTG (On-The-Go) cables have a special pin configuration allowing devices to act as hosts",
    "Many cheap Micro USB cables are charge-only with no data wires - test before trusting"
  ],
  "buying_guide": "For most devices, any Micro USB cable works. For external hard drives or devices needing USB 3.0 speeds, you need the wider USB 3.0 Micro-B cable. For charging, look for cables rated for 2A or higher current. Beware of extremely cheap cables that may be charge-only (missing data wires) or poorly shielded.",
  "notes": "Micro USB was mandated by the EU in 2009 as a common charging standard, leading to its widespread adoption on Android phones. It was designed to be more durable than Mini USB with a rated 10,000 insertion cycles. However, its non-reversible design and fragile-feeling connector led to its replacement by USB-C starting around 2015-2016.",
