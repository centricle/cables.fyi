    "USB 3.x USB-A has 9 pins but is backwards compatible with 4-pin USB 2.0 cables and devices",
    "Blue interior usually indicates USB 3.x, but this is a convention not a requirement",
    "USB-A ports labeled 'SS' (SuperSpeed) support USB 3.x speeds",
    "USB 3.2 Gen 1 was previously called USB 3.0, and USB 3.2 Gen 2 was USB 3.1 - the naming changed in 2019",
    "A USB 2.0 cable in a USB 3.x port will only run at USB 2.0 speeds",
    "USB-A cannot support USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) - that requires USB-C on both ends"
  ],
  "buying_guide": "For USB 3.x speeds, ensure the cable has the blue interior or is explicitly rated for USB 3.0/3.1/3.2. Check for the SuperSpeed (SS) logo. For charging, look for cables rated for higher amperage if using with BC 1.2 chargers. Note that USB-A is limited to 10 Gbps max - for faster speeds, you need USB-C.",
  "notes": "USB-A is the original USB connector and remains ubiquitous on host devices. While being phased out in favor of USB-C, it will remain common for years due to the massive installed base. The connector was intentionally designed to be non-reversible to ensure proper power delivery orientation, though this is often cited as a design flaw compared to USB-C's reversibility.",
