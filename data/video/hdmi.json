    "HDMI 2.1 ports may not support all 2.1 features - manufacturers can pick and choose which features to implement",
    "A 4K@120Hz display requires HDMI 2.1 - HDMI 2.0 maxes out at 4K@60Hz",
    "Not all HDMI cables support all HDMI versions - look for 'Ultra High Speed' for 2.1",
    "HDMI cables are not rated by version number - they're rated by speed (High Speed, Premium High Speed, Ultra High Speed)",
    "VRR and ALLM are HDMI 2.1 features but some 2.0 devices support them via firmware",
    "eARC requires HDMI 2.1 and a compatible cable - regular ARC works on HDMI 1.4+",
    "Mini HDMI and Micro HDMI are physically different connectors with the same capabilities",
    "HDMI ARC only works on specific labeled ports - usually HDMI 1 or 2 on TVs"
  ],
  "buying_guide": "For 4K@60Hz HDR, get a Premium High Speed cable. For 4K@120Hz, 8K, or VRR gaming, you need an Ultra High Speed cable with HDMI 2.1 certification. Look for the holographic label on certified cables. Avoid extremely cheap cables for high-bandwidth uses. Cable length matters - longer cables may not support full bandwidth.",
  "notes": "HDMI has been the dominant consumer A/V connector since the mid-2000s. The transition to HDMI 2.1 has been confusing because manufacturers can implement subsets of features. When buying a TV or monitor for gaming, verify specific feature support (VRR, ALLM, 4K@120Hz) rather than just checking for 'HDMI 2.1' branding.",
